                <h2>Derping Through Life</h2>

                    <p>Hello! My Name is Matt Stewart and I'm originally a California kid. I've lived throughout the state from southern California up to northern California.</p>

                    <p>I was born in Sacramento and lived there until kindergarten where one my my classmates was Tom Hanks' kid: Colin Hanks. My family moved to Redding where I attended first grade and lived there until I graduated high school.</p>
    
                    <p> After high school I moved to Chico where I spent a semester until I became sick and had to move back home to go through treatments and surgery.</p>
    
                    <p> Once my treatments were done, I moved to Santa Barbara with friends where I got into the customer service industry and began playing in bands where partying was more of a priority over the music.</p>

                    <p> Eventually, I decided to persue an college education where I majored in Graphic Design at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco and continued working in customer service to help pay my way through college. I was offered an internship where the money was nothing compared to the living wages of that expensive city, so I left college to be in customer service full time. After working at numerous bars and restaurants, I was offered a job in the cannabis industry where I spent ten years working for a company that was expanding at a rapid pace. Eventually, I left that industry, invested into a catering firm, and then moved from San Francisco to Bend, Oregon to reconnect with family that I had neglected due to an intense ten year work grind.</p>

                    <p> Now I reside in Bend where I'm apart of a program for coding that I must admit I have probably bit off more than I can chew.</p>

                    <p> My overall goal through my life experiences is to be able to be able to wake up happy every day and look forward to that day's challenges.</p>
